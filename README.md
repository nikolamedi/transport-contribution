# Transport's contribution to national CO2 emission
A project comparing transport CO2 emission to other sectors.


# About the code
This is my **very first** Python project completely from scratch. The code might not be the best, but at least it's the best that I was able to come up with! Please bear with me while I learn more and improve my skills.
The idea of this project is to **identify transport's role in national CO2 emissions** and to see how it changed over time. The code simply compares the different columns according to certain conditions and returns a value. In this specific project, it was designed to compare transport CO2 emission with other relevant sectors and indicates in a new row if transport is the largest, second-largest, third-largest, fourth-largest or fifth-largest CO2-emitting sector. 

# Data used
The analysis is based on fossil CO2 emissions by EDGAR. It covers the sectors power, buildings, transport, other combustion and others. Data from 1970 to 2019 has been included for 185 countries (all countries that are part of the UNFCCC).

# Results
The data analysis shows transport is the dominating CO2-emitting sector since 1981 as in the majority of countries it became the largest or second-largest polluting sector. Since 1990 the number of countries recording transport as the largest polluting sector increased significantly and dominates over countries with transport as the second-largest or third-largest sector. The conclusion is that while other sectors were able to decrease their emission, transport CO2 emission continue to grow and will become the largest CO2-emitting sector in more countries.
